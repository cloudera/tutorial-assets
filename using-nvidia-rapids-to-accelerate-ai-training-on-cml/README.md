# Using NVIDIA RAPIDS to Accelerate AI Training in CDP Hybrid Cloud

Experience the benefits of having access to a hybrid cloud solution, which provides us to access many resources, including NVIDIA GPUs. Explore how you can leverage [NVIDIA's RAPIDS](https://rapids.ai/) framework using Cloudera Machine Learning (CML), on the Cloudera Data Platform (CDP). Harness the GPU power and see significant speed improvements compared to commonly used machine learning libraries such as [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) and [Sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/) in both data preprocessing and model training.
