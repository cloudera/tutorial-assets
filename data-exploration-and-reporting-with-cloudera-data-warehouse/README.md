# Data Exploration and Reporting with Cloudera Data Warehouse

Analyze datasets using Data Warehouse on Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) - Public Cloud. We will also visualize our data using Cloudera Data Visualization.

We will be looking at a synthetic data set for a mock company that has various high-tech factories across the world. It was recently noticed that there's been a downturn in revenue for the current fiscal year. We've been tasked to dig into the data to try and find any potential causes as to why this may be.
